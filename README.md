# **CSE-527, Introduction to Computer Vision**

## **Introduction**

In this project we aim to modify the original ResNet architecture by accomodating hand-crafted features like HOG/SIFT in the skip connections between layers.

The original code which we plan on modifying is available at https://github.com/Lasagne/Recipes/tree/master/papers/preactivation_and_wide_resnet.

## **Proposed Architecture**
